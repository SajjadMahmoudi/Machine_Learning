      Sony D-22 portable Diskman forsale
      
      Good condition, flawless.
      
      Costomer AC adapter : 6v DC power supply ( tested 9v DC)
       
       * The factory adapter was tested 12v DC (AC 110v input) at the 
         time I bought it three years ago. When using it, a lot of heat 
         was generated inside the CD machine. Of course I wouldn't use 
         it to risk this baby's life. Maybe that's why so many owners 
         always complain about their portable machine going kaput after 
         a short time usage. 

       * 9v DC factory suggested

Not to mention the thread about selling someone's wife. I am a guy, therefore
not overly bummed by it, but a little common sense would dictate that this
is offensive to many women, and not really necessary.

I'm looking for a Sharp 6220 or TI Travelmate 2000 for parts.  Mine has
a bad RAM chip on the motherboard and I want to see what I can get for
parts before sending it off to Sharp for repairs.  If you have one,
drop me a line.

Also, I'm trying to set one up for a friend who needs to read his old
5 1/4 inch diskettes.  Anyone have the pinout of the diskette expansion
connector on the back of the 3.5 inch floppy box? 

If you respond, please include a phone number. I can't always get through 
with email.
 
As always, 

Thanks,

	Good point, but I was just thinking.. I wanted to sell my HP28sx
calculator here in this newsgroup... It is called a calculator, but really
it is a computer, albeit a small one, but it does function as one... How
come car adds are acceptable? They cant run without computers nowadays....
Where does one draw the line? Accept it, live with it, and if you care to,
avoid it....

  What about the St. Pat. posters from last year?  I have a stack of about 
twenty, and two of the card-board cutouts.  (No, they are NOT for sale, I

Hi, everyone;


I need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster.

Several weeks ago I posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted
an external HD for mac. The scumster - R.E.P. - called my friend and
they agreed on a price. My friend (unexperienced and not too fluent in
English) paid by check, requesting R.E.P. to call him back when the check
arrives and the HD is send. Well, the check was cashed 3/24 and that is
that. Phone # that R.E.P. gave is on the answering machine all the time
and there is no reaction when the message is left; e-mail address does not
bounce but again there is no answer. I know, that R.E.P. is a student at
University of Delaware; I have his e-mail address, his US postal address
and his (?) phone#. The question is: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Sincerely,
Victor Levenson (VVL2H@virginia.edu)

P.S. The reason I did not put R.E.P.'s full name is that I still hope...


P.P.S. If I get enough responses I will post a summary, maybe even on a
regular basis.

Mind my asking why you're selling a used machine with a damaged
keyboard for the about the same price as a brand new A4000/030
(A4000-EC030/4 megs/120meg IDE HD/HD Floppy/v3.0 OS - $1899)?

I'd like to get an A3000 locally for something reasonable like less
than 1K without monitor.  Brand new the A3000-25mhz/50 meg HD/HD
floppy/2.1 ROM isn't running for more than $1400 or so.

Considering it's damaged, probabably has a real old version of the OS
I'll offer $700.  Don't laugh...my A2000 isn't worth more than
$250-$300 these days.

I was wrong! I guess they are closer to $800 new! I will
probably still sell them for the above implied $300 obo.
Email me if you want more specifics. This is a really 
attractive set of books, kind of a Bible encyclopedia set.
Also email me if you know more about these books or post

    Got a few things I want to get rid of...

    Paradise EGA480/Casper EGA Monitor

    1 12 MHz '286 motherboard (DRAM/SIPP)
    1 16 MHz '286 momboard (DRAM only)

    1 Hayes "Prodigy special" 2400b external modem

    1 1Meg SIPP
    1 256K SIPP

    about 2 Megs DRAM (I believe there's 1M of 120ns, and one of 100 or
    80ns, but not absolutely sure).

    Also have an XT with 640K, serial board, Hercules board and amber
    monitor.  The only thing this system is missing is the power supply.


    Make an offer on any/all of this stuff, and thanx for contributing

According to reports, if you don't have DOS yet, and don't have any
utilities (QEMM, Stacker, PCTools, Norton, ...) then DOS6 may be worth it. 

For people who have DOS5, and some sort of utility, DOS6 doesn't offer
much. You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create, however. :-)

3. How to pay

	The first time you use our fax service, we will open an account for you

Hey!  I am interested in buying a digital delay pedal, preferably
capable of sampling and infinite repeat.  (If you're familiar
with Phil Keaggy, I want to mimic, or at least as close as possible,
what he does in concert, i.e., click the pedal, play something, click
it again, and what he played between clicks repeats infinitely while
he playes leads over it)  Anyway, let me know.....

Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman,
the TCD-D7 which is smaller and less expensive than the D3.  Also, the D7
has a coaxial jack which the D3 lacks.  Oh, the D3 has always been
available through mail-order houses for less than $700 dollars new... with
the new model coming out, I suspect the now obsolete D3 will be selling for 
even less.

I'm looking for a used/inexpensive audio mixer.  I need at least 
4 channels of stereo input and 1 channel of stereo output, but I would
prefer 8 or more input channels.  Each channel needs to have at least a 
volume control.  I'll consider buying broken equipment.  The mixer needs 
to be fairly small (I haven't got a lot of space for it).

I'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise. Now, when I
buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I
only pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to
UPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg.
I will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the
right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also
tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.

Other things to watch out for/consider:

	The rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.

	For a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate
	of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the
	same weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many
	cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox
	operator told me I was not telling the truth about
	competitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them
	before with NO problems), etc. Right.

	A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local
	Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the
	remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the
	UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)

	For packages over $100, they charge you about double over
	what UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had
	a claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)
	have told horror stories about them...

	All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by
	Mailbox.

	Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I
	asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared
	to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...

	Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy
	air rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!

	UPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas!

          I  am  cleaning  out  the coffers.  I have a virtually 
          MINT collection of HEAVY METAL magazine.  This is  NOT 
          a  music  mag  but the really neato mag with Giger and 
          Moebius  artwork,  et  al.  Jam  packed  with  amazing 
          sci-fi  and  fantasy artwork by many masters.  All are 
          mint with the exception of the 3 that have split  seam 
          on  the  cover  only but are otherwise perfect, no cut 
          outs or missing pages.  I have Sep, Nov and Dec issues 
          for 1978, ALL issues for 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982,  1983 
          and  Jan  thru  Sep  for  1984  (72  issues  in  all i 
          believe).  I will not break  them  up.  They  will  be 
          sold  as  a  single  lot.  Send  your  offers  to  me. 
          Shipping not included,  these  are  pretty  heavy.  Of 
          course  if  you are local (Mass, USA) you can come get 
          'em in person.

	IMHO, it seems to be worth the $40 to upgrade.  DoubleSpace seems a bit 
saner than Stacker 2.0 (which I've replaced).  MemMaker is nowhere near as 
aggressive as QEMM, but it doesn't hose my system like QEMM did (at least
it hasn't yet).  Microsoft AntiVirus is just the latest version (or a 
reasonably recent one) of CPAV - mine was very aged, so this was quite welcome.

 	MS-DOS 6.0 ain't the end all, be all of operating systems - but it's
better than a sharp stick in the eye, unless you happen to be into that sort 
of thing.  :-)

If anyone's still interested, I have ONE Mattel electronic game left for sale
or trade. It's Baseball (Tan Case) and includes a 9-volt battery and the
original manual!  I was able to sell Soccer and Basketball 2 for $70.00 and
traded the Football game for a Genesis cart...  so, I was happy.  I will
entertain all offers.. cash or Genesis carts...  By the way, Baseball is in
Excellent condition and works perfectly..

Jammer !

 Dit is geen fantastische advertentie over nep-rolexen
 maar een evenzo duidelijke mededeling hieromtrent :

 Aangezien het alleen al aanbieden van deze horloges onder
 vermelding van de echte merknaam niet geheel correct is,
 wil ik met dit bericht duidelijk maken dat ik, Marcel Engelbertink,
 niet meer zal adverteren met imitatie-horloges van het merk ROLEX.

 Enig persoon die hierin geiinteresseerd is kan ik jammer genoeg ook niet
 meer helpen.




 For all the foreign people who can't even understand dutch ?!? :

 In spite of earlier mailing about fake-rolex's, I announce that I
 don't have any information available any longer and I won't use
 the trade name ROLEX anymore for those fake models.


 Yours fakefully,



 M.G. Engelbertink

IRWIN suggests the use of pre-formatted tapes for their tape drives, as
you often can't successfully format a tape and need  bulk-erase it before
you can format it again. Anyway, I have some new, preformatted tapes for
IRWIN 250 tape drives. 
IRWIN accuTRAK series 120-250MB, $16/ea. New never used.
3M DC2120, RHOMAT Format.  $16/ea. Wraped.

Proton P1100 preamplifier
========================= About 3.5 years old, originally $299, asking $150
or best offer.  Has inputs for tape 1, tape 2, CD, phono, video and tuner.
Separate listen and record selectors.  Bass EQ, subharmonic filter and mono
switch.  High quality volume potentiometer.  In excellent condition, with
original boxes and manual.

Sony D-88 portable Diskman
========================== This is the one designed to play the mini CD's.
You can play normal size CDs, but the disk sticks out the side.  Works
well,
but may skip occasionally - it should be tuned up (heads aligned, cleaned,
etc.)  In excellent condition.  It has not been used all that much.  With
carrying case.  Original list was (I think) $300, but I'll take $80 or best
offer.  It would be good for an office or just to sit on your desk.

Hi,

	I have a Humminbird HDR200 Depth Sounder for sale. It
has been used for 1 season on my sailboat. 
	
	All parts are included as well as the installation
instructions. It is even packed in the original box it came in. There
is no damage to the unit or the transducer. In fact, the transducer
was mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull.
So it led a "sheltered" life. The transducer can be mounted either inside
the hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a hole
drilled into your hull.

	It is fully waterproof and fits into a 2" hole in a bulkhead
(that's where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a
powerboat. It reads depth to 199' and has a backlit LCD display. It has
an adjustable shallow water alarm built in. 

	I am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that
outputs the NMEA 0183 information. This little depth sounder works fine
and is very stable.


	It is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, I paid 150$.


	The first 80$ takes it, or best offer.

I have recently graduated and am looking to move into a bigger house,
leaving me with a condo to sell...  It was originally listed at
59,000, but is now listed at $54,900.  The following is a list of
features.

Master Bedroom 	14x11
Bedroom		11x10
Living Room	16x13
Dining Room	10x9
Kitchen		9x11 w/ extra cabinets
1 Full / Modern Bathroom
Full wtw carpeting /new/ excluding bath, Oil hot water heating
/converting to gas this summer/, central air, condo fee $183/mo
INCLUDING heat; hot water; landscaping; pool; tennis courts.  

In addition: washer, dryer /both in condo/, refrigerator, dishwasher,
2 ceiling fans, all window treatments /I don't understand why I can't
call them curtains.../, and a mantle!

Large storage room in private basement, plenty of undesignated
parking.

If you'd like to free me for the bliss of regular homeownership,
please call Kathleen Sullivan at the Rohrer&Sayers Real Estate Agency:
609-546-0004.  She'll arrange for a showing off.

Now for that disclaimer caca:  Subject to errors, changes, ommissions,
withdrawls, and sales without notice.

This posting is not to benefit or at the request of any commercial
agency.  I simply want out.  Flames can be sent to /dev/null

Sorry to waste the bandwidth. Does anyone know a software mail order company 
called "Software Unlimited"? I ordered a software from them and they charged my
credit card but never did send the package to me.

I call them many times but nobody answer the phone. I also check Computer
Shoppers and found they don't advertise anymore. If you know if they are still
in business or you know how to contact them, please tell me.

Thank you very much.

He is probably referring to the DOS version.. the dos versions is up

do not pay $40 for floppy drives.. they are about $40 new.
also, you do not need documentation for floppies. installation
for these things are idiot proof. 
just some advice..

i installed dos 6 last week, and had nothing but trouble afterwards.
windows apps are hitting protection faults more than a kid can do 
to a pinata, and it does not seem to like to work with NDOS (norton 
dos 7.0).  other probs include:

set pcplus=d:\pcplus for procomm plus no longer works.
many of the little utilities to written for dos no longer works
	either. (mostly shareware)

i now have uninstalled dos 6 , and dos 5 works just fine.
are there any apps that dos 6 will be able to run that dos 5 wont?

Looking to save money?  I am your man.  I will mail you 
$5 in food coupons for only$2.50.  Or you will get twice the dollar amount
of coupons.  So mail $15 and get $30 dollars in coupons. Sounds like a great
deal well it is.  Send SASE to 766 S.Elizabeth St. Salt Lake City, Utah 84102
enclose money in form of a money order.  Personally, I would not trust a person
to send coupons after money is sent.  Well, let me earn your trust.  Send
$1 dollar, and I'll send you your $2 in store coupons.  
Then we'll talk more
e-mail enquiries to yb025@uafhp.uark.edu

Thank you,
John Schiefer

	It's an experiment, place a not so subliminal, slightly
cagey message in front of a viewer and see how long it takes to create a response, and what was the response...
	It was the same thing with the "Blow me" message, only it had a
quicker response time...and some unexpected responses along with the
expectedly negative ones...
	Anyone see how long that took?
